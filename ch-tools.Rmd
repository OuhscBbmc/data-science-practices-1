Considerations when Selecting Tools {#tools}
====================================

### The Component's Goal

While disussing the advantages and disadvanages of tools, a colleague once said, "Tidyverse packages don't do anything that I can't already do in Base R, and sometimes it even requires more lines of code".  Regardless if I agree, I feel these two points are irrelevant.  Sometimes the advantage of a tool isn't to expand existing capabilities, but rather to facilitate development and maintaince for the same capability.

Likewise, I care less about the line count, and more about the readability.  I'd prefer to maintain a 20-line chunk that is familar and readable than a 10-line chunk with dense phrases and unfamiliar functions.  The bottleneck for most of our projects is human time, not execution time.

R Packages
------------------------------------

1. When developing a codebase used by many people on your team, choose packages both on their functionality, as well as their ease of installation and maintainability.  For example, the [rJava](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava) package is a powerful package that allows R package developers to leverage the widespread [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) framework and many popular Java packages.  However, installing Java and setting the appropriate [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) or [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) settings can be error-prone, especially for non-developers.  

    Therefore if when considering between two functions with comparable capabilities (*e.g.*, [`xlsx::read.xlsx()`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsx) and [`readxl::read_excel()`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html)), avoid the package that requires a proper installation and configuration of Java and rJava.
