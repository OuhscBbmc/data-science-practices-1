Example Dashboard {#example-dashboard}
====================================


Communicating quantitative trends to a community with a phobia of math can be difficult.  In this appendix, we include a style guide for our dashboards, and a dashboard (with synthetic data) that mimics a recent CQI project where Home Visitors implemented their own intervention ideas.  The [BBMC](https://ouhsc.edu/bbmc/) helped produce the data pipeline and dashboards during the evaluation.

Please view the active html at [qqq]().  The dashboard source code is available in the [`analysis/dashboard-1`](https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton/tree/master/analysis/dashboard-1) directory of the [R Analysis Skeleton](https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton) repository, which documents and contains the code for the entire pipeline leading up to this dashboard.
