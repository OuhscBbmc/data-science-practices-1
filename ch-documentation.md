### GitHub Issue Template {#documentation-issue-template}

If you are going to open up a repo/package to the public, consider creating a [template for GitHub Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) that's tailored to the repo's unique characteristics.  Furthermore, invite feedback from your userbase to improve the template.  Here is our appeal in [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues/291) that produced the [Unexpected Behavior issue template](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/unexpected-behavior-issue-template.md):

> \@nutterb \@haozhu233, \@rparrish, \@sybandrew, and any one else, if you have time, please look at the [new issue template](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/unexpected-behavior-issue-template.md) that is customized for REDCapR/redcapAPI.  I'd appreciate any feedback that could improve the experience for someone encountering a problem.

> I'd like something to (a) make it easier for the user to provide useful information with less effort and (b) make it easier for us to help more accurately with fewer back-and-forths.  And if the template happens to help the user identify and solve the problem without creating the issue  ...then I think everyone is happier too.

> I think the issue should leverage the [Troubleshooter](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/articles/TroubleshootingApiCalls.html) that 10+ people have contributed to.  It should help locate the problematic area more quickly.

> \@haozhu233, it seems you've liked the [template in kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).  REDCapR is different in the sense it's more difficult to provide a minimal & self-contained example to reproduce the problem.  But with your experience with so many users and issues, I'd love any advice.

> \@nutterb, I'd like this template to be helpful to [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) too.  There are only three quick find-and-replace occurrences of 'REDCapR' -> 'redcapAPI'.  And those were mostly to distinguish the R package from REDCap itself.
