Git & GitHub for Code Development
====================================

[Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) and [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester) have published a thorough description of using Git from a data scientist's perspective ([Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)), and we recommend following their guidance.  It is consistent with our approach, with a few exceptions noted below.  A complementary resource is *[Team Geek](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1449302440)*, which has insightful advice for the human and collaborative aspects of version control.

GitHub for Collaboration
====================================

1. Somewhat separate from it's version control capabilities, GitHub provides built-in tools for coordinating projects across people and time.  This tools revolves around [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), which allow teammates to 

1. track issues assigned to them and others
1. search if other teammates have encountered similar problems that their facing now (*e.g.*, the new computer can't install the [rJava](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava) package).


There's nothing magical about GitHub issues, but if you don't use them, consider using a similar tool.  Here are some tips from our experience where ~10 statisticians are working in a single project with an upcoming deadline.

1. If you create an error that describes a problem blocking your progress, include both the raw text (*e.g.*, `error: JAVA_HOME cannot be determined from the Registry`) and possibly a screenshot.  The text allows the problem to be more easily searched by people later; the screenshot usually provides extra context that allows other to understand the situation and help more quickly.

1. Include enough broad context and enough specific details that teammates can quickly understand the problem.  Ideally they can even run your code and debug it.  Good recommendations can be found in the Stack Overflow post, ['How to make a great R reproducible example'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example?rq=1), but the issues don't need as complete because your teammates start with more context than a Stack Overflow reader.
