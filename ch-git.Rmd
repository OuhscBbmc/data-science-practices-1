Git & GitHub
====================================

[Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) and [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester) have published a thorough description of using Git from a data scientist's perspective ([Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)), and we recommend following their guidance.  It is consistent with our approach, with a few exceptions noted below.  A complementary resource is *[Team Geek](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1449302440)*, which has insightful advice for the human and collaborative aspects of version control.
